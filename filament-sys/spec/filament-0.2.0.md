# Part I: Concepts

## 1. Preamble

### 1.1. Scope

This document defines the **Filament Specification**, a standard for a deterministic, event-sourced partitioning kernel. It defines the three normative layers required for compliance with the standard:

1.  **The Kernel Interface:** The low-level execution contract and binary interface.
2.  **The Process Manifest:** A declarative schema defining process topology.
3.  **The Capability Model:** The security and capability interfaces of a kernel.

### 1.2. Status

This is a draft specification. The Application Binary Interface and Schema defined herein are **not** guaranteed to be forward or backward compatible.

### 1.3. Normative Status

Unless explicitly marked as **Informative**, all sections in this document are **Normative**.

### 1.4. Keywords

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## 2. Architecture Overview [Informative]

### 2.1 System Model

Filament implements a partitioned, event-sourced architecture. The system is composed of three hierarchical abstractions:

1.  **The Process:** The static definition of the workload, including topology, configuration, and permissions.
2.  **The Kernel:** The runtime executive that manages scheduling, memory, and I/O.
3.  **The Module:** The individual unit of logic that executes within a sandboxed or trusted context.

Execution is transactional. The Kernel advances the system state through atomic cycles called **Weaves**. During a Weave, the Kernel injects a deterministic **Virtual Time** and provides a transient **Staging Area** for inter-module communication.

### 2.2 The Kernel

The Kernel acts as a user-space scheduler and memory manager. It is responsible for loading Modules, enforcing the Application Binary Interface (ABI), and driving the Weave cycle.

Unlike a general-purpose OS kernel which manages contention for hardware, the Filament Kernel manages the logical flow of causality. It enforces isolation by strictly mediating all data exchange through the Staging Area. If a Module violates its resource budget (time or memory) or attempts an illegal operation, the Kernel discards the pending state of the current cycle, ensuring the underlying Timeline remains consistent.

### 2.3 The Process

A Process is the container for the execution timeline. It is defined declaratively by a Manifest, which creates an immutable binding between a set of Modules and their configuration.

The Process state is defined exclusively by its **Timeline**, an append-only log of committed events. By decoupling the Process definition from the host hardware, Filament ensures that a Process creates identical Timeline entries given the same input history, regardless of the underlying host topology.

### 2.4 The Module

A Module is a binary artifact that implements the Filament ABI. It functions as a pure transformation logic, accepting input events from the Staging Area and producing uncommitted output events.

Modules operate within specific **Execution Contexts** that determine their capabilities:

- **Logic Contexts** rely on WebAssembly to enforce strict memory isolation and deterministic arithmetic.
- **System Contexts** utilize native linkage to provide low-latency access to host hardware.

### 2.5 Deployment Topologies

The architecture supports two distinct host mappings:

- **Hosted Topology:** The Kernel executes as a standard process within a Host OS. The Kernel schedules Modules internally, effectively functioning as a green-thread scheduler. This is used for simulation and high-density cloud workloads.
- **Native Topology:** The Kernel executes directly on the hardware metal. The Kernel manages physical interrupts and CPU cycles directly. This is used for real-time safety controllers where jitter from a Host OS is unacceptable.

---

## 3. Execution Contexts

Because Filament supports diverse execution environments, the specification defines **Execution Contexts** to manage this disversity safely. These contexts determine the loader type, the available capabilities, and the preemption guarantees enforced by the Kernel.

### 3.1 System Context

This context is designed for hardware abstraction, high-frequency sensor ingestion, and actuator control.

- **Artifacts:** Native Shared Objects are preferred. WebAssembly is supported only if the Kernel provides specific **HAL Intrinsics** (Hardware Abstraction Layer).
- **Privilege:** High. Native modules in this context may access memory-mapped I/O and interrupts.
- **Constraint:** Real-Time. Execution is subject to strict watchdog timers. Native code in this context is implicitly trusted and must yield cooperatively.
  - _Note on Hosted Topology:_ In a Hosted deployment, "Hard Real-Time" guarantees are subject to the capabilities of the underlying Host OS (e.g., requiring `PREEMPT_RT` patches).

### 3.2 Managed Context

This context is designed for **Orchestration**: network I/O, database connectivity, and external API integration.

- **Artifacts:** WebAssembly using Managed Runtimes or Process-Isolated Native binaries (on hosted topologies).
- **Privilege:** Networked. Modules may access TCP/HTTP interfaces and persistent key-value storage.
- **Memory Model:**
  - **Stateful (Default):** The instance persists between Weaves.
  - **Stateless (Pooled):** The instance is wiped and returned to a pool after execution.
- **Constraints:**
  - The Kernel **MUST** reject a Module defined as `stateless` if it requests any capability marked as **[Pinned]** in the Capability Model (e.g., Hardware Drivers).

### 3.3 Logic Context

This context is designed for **Pure Computation**: business logic, control algorithms, and safety verifiers.

- **Artifacts:** Strict WebAssembly.
- **Privilege:** Restricted. Modules may only access the Staging Area via the `filament.bus` capability. They have **NO** network access and **NO** hardware access.
- **Constraints:**
  - **State Hygiene:** The Kernel **MUST** reset the Module's linear memory and global state to its initial definition at the start of every Weave. Memory MUST NOT persist between cycles.
  - **Stochastic Isolation:** The execution is closed over its inputs. Pseudo-random operations must derive strictly from the cryptographic seed provided by the Kernel.
  - **Monotonicity:** The operation preserves history. If the result is a successful timeline commit, the input history is strictly a prefix of the new timeline.
  - **Preemption:** The Kernel may preempt execution at any instruction boundary using instruction metering.

### 3.4 Arithmetic Determinism

| ID           | Requirement                                                                                              |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IR-3.4.1** | The Kernel **MUST** configure the execution engine for WASM modules to enforce **NaN Canonicalization**. |

## 4. The Kernel Model

### 4.1 The Pipeline Transaction

Execution in Filament is transactional and cyclical. This cycle is called a **Weave**.

1.  **Ingress:** The Kernel places pending Input Events onto the Staging Area.
2.  **Execution:** The Kernel invokes the Modules in sequential order defined by the Pipeline.
3.  **Commit:** If **ALL** Modules in the pipeline complete successfully, the Kernel commits the resulting Events to the Timeline and **flushes pending Hardware/Side-Effect Buffers** to physical interfaces.
4.  **Discard:** If **ANY** Module traps, panics, or exceeds its resource budget, the Kernel discards the Staging Area and **clears all pending Hardware/Side-Effect Buffers**. No physical actuation occurs.

### 4.2 Timekeeping Models

To support both real-time interaction and deterministic simulation, the Kernel **MUST** maintain two distinct clocks:

1.  **Wall Clock (`timestamp`):** Unix Epoch (ns). Represents physical time. Not guaranteed to be unique or monotonic.
2.  **Causal Clock (`tick`):** Monotonically increasing 64-bit integer. Represents the logical step index. **MUST** be unique per event.

### 4.3 Resource Accounting

To ensure deterministic execution across different Host implementations, Filament uses an abstract resource model. `resource_used` and `resource_max` (in `FilamentWeaveInfo`) are **opaque** monotonic counters representing **Compute Units** (often mapped to Instruction Counts in Wasm). Plugins **MUST** treat the ratio of `resource_used` to `resource_max` as a unitless throttling metric. If `resource_used` exceeds `resource_max`, the Kernel **MAY** terminate the Weave cycle immediately and return `FILAMENT_ERR_TIMEOUT`.

### 4.4 Concurrency and Isolation

The Kernel **MUST** guarantee that only one instance of a Module executes against a given timeline at any time. `weave()` invocations are serialized.

- **Instance Pooling:** Hosts **MAY** execute multiple Agents concurrently using instance pooling. Pooled modules **MUST** declare themselves to be stateless.
- **State Clearing:**
  - The Host **MUST** zero-initialize the Module's linear memory and global state for non-native modules any time a module is invoked with a new Agent ID.
  - The Host **MAY** zero-initialize the Module's linear memory and global state for non-native modules between Weaves for the same Agent ID.

---

## 5. Data Lifecycle

Filament treats data as a stream of events. Modules communicate by reading and writing events to a transient timeline, which is then persisted based on policy.

### 5.1 The Timeline

The **Timeline** is the authoritative log of the Process.

- **Index:** Events are referenced by a 64-bit unsigned integer. Indices **MUST** be strictly monotonically increasing.
- **Access:** Modules read historical data via a cursor API to support pagination of large datasets.

### 5.2 Timeline Retention Policies

Different domains require different data retention policies. The Kernel enforces one of the following policies per Process, defined in the Manifest.

- **Strict Policy (Append-Only):** Events are immutable once committed. No deletion or modification is permitted. Suitable for audit logs.
- **Prunable Policy (Retention):** The Timeline maintains a strictly ordered tail of events. The Kernel **MAY** delete the oldest events to reclaim storage space. Existing indices are **NOT** shifted; deleted indices become permanently invalid.
- **Mutable Policy (Redaction):** Events may be logically redacted using **Tombstones**. The event payload is wiped, but the index and header remain to preserve causal ordering.

### 5.3 The Staging Area

The **Staging Area** is the transient medium for inter-module communication. It is zero-initialized at the start of every Weave. Events written here are tentative proposals until the Weave commits.

### 5.4 Blob Mapping

For high-bandwidth assets, such as Lidar point clouds or Video frames, the Kernel uses **Blob Mapping** to avoid copy overhead.

- **Creation:** System contexts allocate Blobs via `filament_blob_alloc`. This may return a pointer to DMA-safe memory.
- **Ephemerality:** Blobs created during a Weave are destroyed at the end of that Weave unless they are explicitly referenced in the committed Timeline or retained.
- **Retention:** Stateful modules wishing to preserve a Blob across Weaves without publishing it **MUST** call `filament_blob_retain`.
- **Safety Trap:** Accessing a Blob ID that was not retained or committed in a previous Weave **MUST** trigger a Kernel Trap.

# Part II: The Kernel Interface

## 1. System Conventions

### 1.1 Binary Format

- **Byte Order:** All multi-byte integers **MUST** be encoded using **Little-Endian**.
- **Alignment:** All ABI structures **MUST** be aligned to 8-byte boundaries.
- **Pointers:** Defined as **`FilamentAddress`**, an alias for `u64`.
  - **Guest Pointers:** In Wasm, these are zero-extended offsets relative to linear memory 0. In Native, these are 64-bit virtual addresses within the module space.
  - **Handles:** Opaque handles are typed as `u64` and are **NOT** dereferenceable by the module.

### 1.2 Calling Convention

- **Interface:** All exported and imported functions **MUST** adhere to the standard **C Calling Convention** of the target architecture.
- **Signature:** All functions accept exactly two parameters: `ctx` (`u64`) and `args_ptr` (`FilamentAddress`).
- **Thread Safety:** Kernel Interface functions differ in their concurrency guarantees:
  - **Context Handles (`ctx`):** These are **Thread-Local** and **MUST NOT** be shared or used concurrently by multiple threads.
  - **Channel Operations:** Functions operating on dynamic channels (`filament_read`, `filament_write`) are **Thread-Safe**. The Kernel **MUST** synchronize access to the underlying Ring Buffers, allowing concurrent reads and writes from different Execution Contexts.

### 1.3 Documentation Conventions

Function definitions use **Compliance Tables** to define normative constraints.

- **Valid Usage (VU):** Constraints the **Caller** must honor. Violating these results in Undefined Behavior or Kernel Traps.
- **Implementation Requirements (IR):** Behaviors the **Kernel** must implement. Violating these renders the Kernel Non-Compliant.

In future versions:

- Existing IDs **SHALL NOT** be renumbered.
- Deleted requirements **SHALL** leave a gap in the sequence.
- New requirements **SHALL** be appended to the end of the list.

### 1.4 URI Handling

URI's are not normalized by the Kernel in Filament.

**Valid Usage:**

| ID           | Requirement                                                                                                        |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VU-1.4.1** | The Caller **SHOULD** ensure all URIs passed to the Kernel are pre-normalized to **IETF RFC 3986** canonical form. |

**Implementation Requirements:**

| ID           | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IR-1.4.1** | The Kernel **MUST** perform a byte-wise comparison when matching URIs.                                                                                                      |
| **IR-1.4.2** | The Kernel **MUST** reject URIs containing embedded null characters (`\0`) or non-printable ASCII control characters with `FILAMENT_ERR_INVALID`.                           |
| **IR-1.4.3** | When matching module input/output topologies (linking), the Kernel **MUST** require exact binary equality between the Producer's declared Topic and the Consumer's Binding. |

### 1.5 Data Format Guidelines

To ensure ecosystem interoperability, Host Runtimes responsible for parsing user configuration and invoking `filament_process_spawn` **SHOULD** adhere to the following data format guidelines:

1.  **Recommended Format:** Hosts **SHOULD** support **TOML v1.0** as the primary format for Process Manifests. Its strict typing, simple parsing rules, and deterministic parsing semantics align with Filament's safety and portability goals.
2.  **Discouraged Format:** Hosts **SHOULD NOT** use YAML for normative configuration due to its ambiguity, unsafe type inference, parsing overhead, and parser size.
3.  **Alternative Formats:** Hosts **MAY** support other deterministic formats as implementation details, provided that they can be losslessly mapped to the `FilamentProcessSpawnArgs` ABI structure.

### 1.6 WebAssembly Import Namespace

To ensure portability across different Host Runtimes, WebAssembly modules **MUST** import all Kernel Interface functions from the module namespace `filament`.

| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IR-4.11.1** | The Kernel **MUST** execute teardown in strict order: suspend child, destroy channels owned by child, and free child resources.                                                    |
| **IR-4.11.2** | Upon successful termination, the Kernel **MUST** credit the child's memory limit back to the parent's available budget.                                                            |
| **IR-4.11.3** | If a process is terminated in the same Weave cycle it was spawned, the Kernel **MUST** simply discard the pending spawn record. The Child **MUST NOT** be initialized or executed. |

# Part III: The Capability Model

## 1. Capability Concepts

Capabilities are identified by Uniform Resource Names (URNs). A Module cannot perform I/O unless the capability is explicitly requested in the Manifest.

### 1.1 Event Directionality

- **Outbound:** Events written _by_ the Module _to_ the Staging Area via `filament_write`.
- **Inbound:** Events written _by_ the Kernel _to_ the Staging Area, read via `filament_read`.

### 1.2 The Symbol Table

Capabilities may authorize the use of direct kernel functions resolved via the Linker.

- **Host Functions:** Symbols exported by the Kernel (e.g., `filament_channel_create`).
- **Module Functions:** Symbols exported by the Module (e.g., `filament_init`).

### 1.3 Security Enforcement

The Kernel **MUST** validate every Outbound event against the Module's granted capabilities. If a Module emits an event for a capability it does not possess, the Kernel **MUST** reject the event with `FILAMENT_ERR_PERM`.

### 1.4 Capability Affinity

Capabilities enforce constraints on the execution model of the consuming Module.

- **Agnostic:** Safe for Instance Pooling. The Module uses the capability via atomic events or transient handles.
- **Pinned:** Requires a persistent execution context. These capabilities typically involve hardware locking, expensive initialization, or DMA mappings that cannot be safely reset between Weaves.

**Implementation Requirements:**

| ID           | Requirement                                                                                                                        |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IR-1.4.1** | The Kernel **MUST** reject the loading of any Module that declares a **Stateless** lifecycle but requests a **Pinned** capability. |

---

## 2. Capability Catalog

### 2.1 filament.core

The foundational capability set required for the Filament lifecycle. It provides memory management, structured logging, error signaling, and panic handling. This capability is **implicitly granted** to all Modules.

**Affinity:** Agnostic

**Authorized Host Functions:**

- `filament_blob_alloc`
- `filament_blob_map`
- `filament_blob_retain`
- `filament_read`
- `filament_write`

**Events:**

| Topic                 | Direction | Payload Type          | Description                     |
| :-------------------- | :-------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `filament/core/log`   | Outbound  | `FilamentLogRecord`   | Emits a structured log message. |

| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IR-2.1.1** | Upon receiving a `filament/core/panic` event, the Kernel **MUST** mark the Process as faulted, discard the Staging Area (rollback), and transition the system to a Safe State.   |
| **IR-2.1.2** | The Kernel **SHOULD** forward events from `filament/core/log` to the configured host telemetry sink.                                                                             |
| **IR-2.1.3** | When handling `filament/core/log`, the Kernel **MUST** validate that the payload matches the `FilamentLogRecord` ABI.                                                            |
| **IR-2.1.4** | Blobs created via `filament_blob_alloc` **MUST** be destroyed at the end of the Weave unless `filament_blob_retain` is called or the Blob ID is referenced in a committed event. |

# Appendices

## Appendix A: Glossary [Informative]

This glossary defines the standard nomenclature used throughout the Filament Specification.

| Term             | Definition                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blob**         | A reference-counted, Kernel-managed memory buffer used for zero-copy I/O. Blobs allow Modules to exchange large assets (e.g., video frames) without copying them into the Staging Area. |
| **Capability**   | A strictly typed permission token, identified by a URN (e.g., `filament.net.http`), that grants a Module access to specific Kernel resources or I/O operations.                         |
| **Channel:**     | A persistent, typed ring-buffer used for asynchronous communication between processes.                                                                                                  |
| **Context**      | The execution environment that defines the privileges, loader requirements, and preemption constraints of a Module.                                                                     |
| **Kernel**       | The runtime authority responsible for scheduling, safety enforcement, and resource management. It is the only entity with direct access to the host hardware or OS.                     |
| **Manifest**     | A declarative configuration file that defines the Process topology, resource constraints, and capability requirements.                                                                  |
| **Module**       | The executable binary artifact (Wasm or Native) that implements the Filament Interface. Modules are the atomic units of deployment.                                                     |
| **Pipeline**     | An ordered chain of Modules configured to execute sequentially within a single Process.                                                                                                 |
| **Process**      | The unit of isolation consisting of a Cryptographic Identity, an Immutable Timeline, and an Executable Pipeline.                                                                        |
| **Schema**       | A formal definition of the data structure expected on a specific Event Topic. The Kernel uses Schemas to enforce link-time type safety between Modules.                                 |
| **Staging Area** | The transient, zero-persistence memory interface used to pass data between Modules during a Weave.                                                                                      |
| **Tick**         | A strictly monotonically increasing 64-bit integer representing the logical step index of the Timeline. Unlike Virtual Time, Ticks are unique and provide a total ordering of events.   |
| **Timeline**     | The immutable, strictly ordered log of all committed events representing the Process history.                                                                                           |
| **Virtual Time** | A logical clock injected by the Kernel to ensure deterministic execution. It allows the execution speed to be decoupled from the host OS wall clock.                                    |
| **Weave:**       | The atomic, transactional execution cycle where the Kernel drives inputs through the Pipeline and commits results to the Timeline.                                                      |

## Appendix B: Conformance

A Kernel is considered **Compliant** if it passes the **Kernel Compliance Kit** (KCK). The KCK validates host behavior against the normative requirements defined in this document through the following test suites:

1.  **ABI Layout Verification:** Validates that the Kernel correctly parses binary structures and enforces alignment/padding rules.
2.  **Lifecycle Fuzzing:** Validates that the Kernel correctly handles state transitions (Init -> Weave -> Error) and cleans up resources after a crash.
3.  **Capability Enforcement:** Validates that the Kernel rejects unauthorized I/O attempts and enforces Access Control Lists.
4.  **Determinism Checks:** Validates that Logic Modules produce bitwise-identical outputs given identical inputs and seeds, regardless of wall-clock time.
5.  **Resource Governance:** Validates that the Kernel correctly interrupts Modules that exceed their time or memory budgets.
6.  **Concurrency Safety:** Validates that the Kernel correctly handles Ring Buffer overflows, Wake-on-Close behavior, and memory isolation between Shared and Dedicated processes.
